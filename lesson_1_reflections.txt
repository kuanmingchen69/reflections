How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
You can see your thinking path and that helps you realize what has been done wrong and makes a good impression for you to avoid the same mistake in the future.
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
You can have clear logics of how it was done, in details and as a whole.
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
You self know your pace better than the computer.
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because multiple files are related to each other.
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log provids IDs of recent commits that you can use to compare changes between two commits through git diff.
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
You always have a chance to go backward.
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I would like to know how to use branches.
